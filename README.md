# Netflix Viewing Activity Analysis

## Project Overview
The project focuses on analyzing a Netflix dataset obtained directly from Netflix via a personal data request. The dataset includes various types of information such as user profile details, device usage, IP addresses, messages, and surveys. However, the primary focus will be on **viewing activity** to understand changes in personal streaming habits.

## Objective
- **Initial Engagement:** Initially, long viewing sessions were possible, with sustained usage in the app.
- **Recent Behavior:** There is a noticeable decline in session duration and an inability to watch content continuously in a single sitting.

## Methodology
### Dataset Preparation
- Extract relevant information related to viewing activity (e.g., timestamps, titles watched, session duration).
- Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.

### Categorization
- Organize the data into time periods (e.g., by year or month) to observe trends over time.

### Analysis and Visualization
- Use data visualization techniques such as:
  - Line charts to display trends in session duration.
  - Heatmaps to explore usage patterns across different days or months.
  - Histograms or pie charts for distribution analysis (e.g., genres watched most frequently over time).
- Identify any significant shifts in usage behavior.

### Statistical Testing
- Conduct hypothesis testing or time-series analysis to validate observed trends.
- Compare means or medians of session durations across different periods to test for significant changes.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Software:** Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), or other statistical and visualization tools (e.g., Excel, Tableau, R).
- **Statistical Methods:** T-tests, ANOVA, or regression analysis to analyze shifts in viewing patterns.
- **Visualization Techniques:** Interactive and static plots to make insights clearer.

## Expected Outcome
- A comprehensive view of personal viewing habits over time.
- Insights into changes in streaming behavior, helping to understand what factors might have contributed to these shifts.
- Visualizations and statistical evidence to support the observations.
