In this project i will be using my Netflix dataset which i received from Netflix via request. The dataset has many items including my profile, devices, ip adresses messages and surveys but i am planning to focus on  my viewing activity. When i have started to use my account, i was able to stay in the app during long hours but nowadays i feel like my duration time in the app got shorter and i can't watch anything in a single sitting. So i am planning to categorise my dataset according to years or months and compare them with each other using the necessary tests.
