Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Netflix dataset obtained directly from Netflix via a personal data request. The dataset includes various types of information, such as user profile details, device usage, IP addresses, messages, and surveys. However, the primary focus will be on viewing activity to examine changes in personal streaming habits.

Objective
The goal is to investigate patterns in viewing behavior over time, with specific attention to:

Initial Engagement: The ability to sustain long viewing sessions in the past.
Recent Behavior: A noticeable decline in session duration and difficulty watching content in a single sitting.
Methodology
Dataset Preparation:
Extract relevant information related to viewing activity (e.g., timestamps, titles watched, session duration).
Clean and preprocess the data for accurate analysis.
Categorization:
Organize the data into time periods, such as by year or month, to detect trends and patterns.
Analysis and Visualization:
Utilize data visualization techniques, including:
Line charts for trends in session duration.
Heatmaps to reveal activity patterns across days or months.
Histograms or pie charts to analyze distributions (e.g., genres or content types watched).
Identify and interpret significant changes in viewing behavior.
Statistical Testing:
Apply hypothesis testing to assess differences in session duration over time.
Use measures such as t-tests to verify observed trends.
Tools and Techniques
Software: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), or alternatives like Excel, Tableau, or R.
Statistical Methods: Hypothesis testing and comparison of averages across timeframes.
Visualization Techniques: Both interactive and static plots to highlight key findings.
Expected Outcome
The analysis aims to:

Provide a detailed understanding of personal viewing habits over time.
Highlight trends and shifts in streaming behavior.
Present visualizations and statistical insights that validate observed changes.
