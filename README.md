Investigate a noticeable decrease in session duration and the inability to watch content continuously in recent times.
Methodology
Data Preparation: Extract and clean relevant viewing activity data, such as timestamps and session durations.
Categorization: Organize data by year or month to observe trends.
Analysis:
Create visualizations (e.g., line charts, heatmaps, histograms) to highlight patterns.
Apply statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to validate changes over time.
Tools
Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
Optional: Tableau or Excel for additional visualizations.
Expected Outcome
Identify trends and changes in viewing habits.
Present insights with visualizations and statistical evidence.
